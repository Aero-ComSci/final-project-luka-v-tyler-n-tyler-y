# Who is the Program for?
This Python shopping list app is made for anyone who wants to order from a summer concession stand. People are able to order what they want online through the online menu. It's made to be time efficient for people that are busy and value their time.

# What does the program do?
The app gives a user friendly and easy way to create and manage a summer shopping list efficiently. It uses functions in order to allow the user to press the button and add what they want to their order. It uses dictionaries in order to assign numerical values to each item on the menu. It uses lists to remember which buttons the user clicked for their order. It uses for loops in order to create multiple buttons based off of the items in the menu within the dictionary. The program allows the user to add items to their list based off of the menu, remove items from their order, clear their own order and calculate their total.

# Screen Recording
File was too big, here is the [recording]([url](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l28bQhc0XYp5dgRgjGw2YfrabJAhITez/view?usp=sharing)) (go into edit and copy paste the code)


# Day 1
- We brainstormed our idea: Shopping List
- Started our python/tkinter code and created a list to type in the items for your shopping list


# Day 2
- We add the items to the tkinter code and make sure it can run over and over again
- We fix any errors we see when running the program
