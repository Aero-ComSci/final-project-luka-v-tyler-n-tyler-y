# Who is the Program for?
This Python shopping list app is made for anyone who wants to make their summer grocery shopping list. It's made for busy people, cooks, and families trying to have good time management.

# Day 1
- We brainstormed our idea: Shopping List
- Started our python/tkinter code and created a list to type in the items for your shopping list


# Day 2
- We add the loops so it can re-run the entire program over and over to start the next shopping process
- We fix any errors we see when running the program
